# CVS challenge evaluation code
- This repository contains the code for supporting the example code, data loading, and metrics computations, for the CVS challenge.
- See the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Sn2XZi_s-Mj5Ai1yRoFJX3xNhV2sJeYp?usp=sharing) for an example of how to access the challenge data with this code, compute metrics, save results for the challenge, etc.
- Main folders include:
  - `datasets` - example Pytorch dataloader for the data in the challenge.
  - `util` - for utilities, such as metrics computations and results saving/loading from the algorithms.
  - `notebooks` - for example jupyter/colab notebooks.
